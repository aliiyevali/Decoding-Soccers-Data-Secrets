# Introduction

This document presents a comprehensive analysis of data primarily sourced from Transfermarkt.com, focusing on attacking players in professional soccer. The dataset was meticulously scraped from the website, ensuring a rich collection of relevant data.
The initial phase involved cleaning and processing the data using SQL, a step crucial for ensuring accuracy and reliability in the subsequent stages of analysis. This process streamlined the dataset, making it more conducive for detailed examination. I further preprocessed the data using Python. This stage involved refining the dataset, preparing it for more sophisticated analytical techniques.
To enhance my understanding and to present the data in an easily interpretable format, I utilized Tableau for visualization. This allowed me to transform complex data sets into clear, insightful visual representations, making the analysis more accessible.
Advanced statistical methods were employed, including the construction of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. These techniques provided a robust framework for evaluating the data and drawing statistically significant conclusions.
Two predictive models were developed:
1. Logistic Regression Model: This model achieved an accuracy of 0.80 and was designed to predict whether a player is likely to win an individual title in their lifetime. The high accuracy of this model underlines its potential utility for player assessment in professional soccer.
2. Random Forest Model:  With an R-square value of 0.5, this model aimed at predicting the performances of players in next years. The model's moderate predictive power demonstrates its value in forecasting player performances. Once the model has been created and trained using the 2022 goals dataset, the next step is to utilize it for predicting the 2023 goals. Subsequently, we can identify the highest-scoring player in 2023 based on the predictions generated by our model.
