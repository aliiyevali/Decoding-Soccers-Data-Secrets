# Soccer-Player-Analysis

# Introduction

This document presents a comprehensive analysis of data primarily sourced from Transfermarkt.com, focusing on attacking players in professional soccer. The dataset was meticulously scraped from the website, ensuring a rich collection of relevant data.
The initial phase involved cleaning and processing the data using SQL, a step crucial for ensuring accuracy and reliability in the subsequent stages of analysis. This process streamlined the dataset, making it more conducive for detailed examination. I further preprocessed the data using Python. This stage involved refining the dataset, preparing it for more sophisticated analytical techniques.
To enhance my understanding and to present the data in an easily interpretable format, I utilized Tableau for visualization. This allowed me to transform complex data sets into clear, insightful visual representations, making the analysis more accessible.
Advanced statistical methods were employed, including the construction of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. These techniques provided a robust framework for evaluating the data and drawing statistically significant conclusions.
Two predictive models were developed:
1. Logistic Regression Model: This model achieved an accuracy of 0.80 and was designed to predict whether a player is likely to win an individual title in their lifetime. The high accuracy of this model underlines its potential utility for player assessment in professional soccer.
2. Random Forest Model:  With an R-square value of 0.5, this model aimed at predicting the performances of players in next years. The model's moderate predictive power demonstrates its value in forecasting player performances. Once the model has been created and trained using the 2022 goals dataset, the next step is to utilize it for predicting the 2023 goals. Subsequently, we can identify the highest-scoring player in 2023 based on the predictions generated by our model.
The key variables include:

Name: The player's name.
Sub-Position: Specific playing position.
Country: Player's country of origin.
Matches: Total matches played.
Goals: Total goals scored.
CurrentValue(M): The current market value of the player in millions.
Progress: The player's performance progress over the last three years.
Age: The age of the player.
Minutes: Total minutes played by the player.
Injury_Sum: Total Matches missed by player due to injury.
Achievements: Career achievements.
Assist Per Season: Average assists per season.
League, Team: Current playing league and team.
Goals by Year (2020, 2021, 2022): Goals scored in specific years.
League_Code: League representation code.
Cups: Number of cups won.
Position: Numerical code for playing position.

# Confidence Intervals

Case Introduction: 
Imagine a scenario where one of the prominent Manchester football clubs faces a sudden setback as their star striker sustains a season-ending injury. With their key player sidelined, the club urgently seeks to bolster their squad by acquiring a top-tier attacking player to maintain their competitive edge in the upcoming season. To ensure they make an informed and confident decision, they turn to us (data analyst) with a crucial question: How much can they expect to pay for a young & quality attacking player while asked to being highly confident (95%) in the estimated price?
     Analysis:
My analysis commences by delving into the dataset, focusing on soccer players' values, with a particular emphasis on a variable known as "Currentvalue(M)," representing the market value of players in millions. This variable plays a pivotal role in deciphering various facets of player dynamics, including performance, popularity, and market demand.
In light of the specific scenario where a Manchester club seeks a replacement striker, we will continue with a selected subgroup of players. This subgroup consists of young attacking players aged between 22 to 28 years and those deemed "good" based on their ContributionPermin, which falls below 140. This meticulous filtering mirrors the practical need to identify high-potential attacking talents. 
Our methodology for estimating the market value of these sought-after young and high-performing attacking players in 2023 involves the utilization of the sampling concept. I utilize the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in our analysis because performing t-statistic tests on non-normally distributed data can be problematic. By applying CLT, I transform the player values within this specific subset into smaller, manageable samples. Within each of these samples, we calculate the average market value. This approach allows analysis to provide valuable insights into the typical market value exhibited by players meeting these stringent criteria while addressing the challenges posed by non-normal data distributions.
