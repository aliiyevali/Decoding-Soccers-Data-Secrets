# Soccer-Player-Analysis

# Introduction

This document presents a comprehensive analysis of data primarily sourced from Transfermarkt.com, focusing on attacking players in professional soccer. The dataset was meticulously scraped from the website, ensuring a rich collection of relevant data.
The initial phase involved cleaning and processing the data using SQL, a step crucial for ensuring accuracy and reliability in the subsequent stages of analysis. This process streamlined the dataset, making it more conducive for detailed examination. I further preprocessed the data using Python. This stage involved refining the dataset, preparing it for more sophisticated analytical techniques.
To enhance my understanding and to present the data in an easily interpretable format, I utilized Tableau for visualization. This allowed me to transform complex data sets into clear, insightful visual representations, making the analysis more accessible.
Advanced statistical methods were employed, including the construction of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. These techniques provided a robust framework for evaluating the data and drawing statistically significant conclusions.
Two predictive models were developed:
1. Logistic Regression Model: This model achieved an accuracy of 0.80 and was designed to predict whether a player is likely to win an individual title in their lifetime. The high accuracy of this model underlines its potential utility for player assessment in professional soccer.
2. Random Forest Model:  With an R-square value of 0.5, this model aimed at predicting the performances of players in next years. The model's moderate predictive power demonstrates its value in forecasting player performances. Once the model has been created and trained using the 2022 goals dataset, the next step is to utilize it for predicting the 2023 goals. Subsequently, we can identify the highest-scoring player in 2023 based on the predictions generated by our model.

# Confidence Intervals

Case Introduction: 
Imagine a scenario where one of the prominent Manchester football clubs faces a sudden setback as their star striker sustains a season-ending injury. With their key player sidelined, the club urgently seeks to bolster their squad by acquiring a top-tier attacking player to maintain their competitive edge in the upcoming season. To ensure they make an informed and confident decision, they turn to us (data analyst) with a crucial question: How much can they expect to pay for a young & quality attacking player while asked to being highly confident (95%) in the estimated price?
     Analysis:
My analysis commences by delving into the dataset, focusing on soccer players' values, with a particular emphasis on a variable known as "Currentvalue(M)," representing the market value of players in millions. This variable plays a pivotal role in deciphering various facets of player dynamics, including performance, popularity, and market demand.
In light of the specific scenario where a Manchester club seeks a replacement striker, we will continue with a selected subgroup of players. This subgroup consists of young attacking players aged between 22 to 28 years and those deemed "good" based on their ContributionPermin, which falls below 140. This meticulous filtering mirrors the practical need to identify high-potential attacking talents. 
Our methodology for estimating the market value of these sought-after young and high-performing attacking players in 2023 involves the utilization of the sampling concept. I utilize the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in our analysis because performing t-statistic tests on non-normally distributed data can be problematic. By applying CLT, I transform the player values within this specific subset into smaller, manageable samples. Within each of these samples, we calculate the average market value. This approach allows analysis to provide valuable insights into the typical market value exhibited by players meeting these stringent criteria while addressing the challenges posed by non-normal data distributions.
Final dataset after CLT implementation:

To provide the Manchester club with a highly confident (95%) estimate of how much acquiring such a player might cost in 2023, we employ statistical techniques to determine confidence intervals around the sample means. These intervals offer an estimate of the likely range in which the true average market value of these players resides, given our sample data. The use of a specific multiplier in the calculation assures a 95% level of confidence, demonstrating our commitment to precision. Based on our rigorous analysis, we estimate that the market value for these promising young attacking players in 2023 falls within the range of $26 million to $42 million, thus empowering the Manchester club to make a well-informed and confident decision in their pursuit of a replacement striker.

# Hypothesis Testing

Some experts suggest that left-footed players have more abilities in playmaking, such as providing assists, while right-footed players are often associated with having better finishing skills when it comes to scoring goals. This raises the question of whether these notions are grounded or if they are merely myths in the world of soccer. To shed light on this topic and investigate whether there is a substantial difference in playmaking abilities between left-footed and right-footed players, I will conduct an analysis using statistical methods to determine the validity of these claims.
Non-Normal distributions of Goals by Right, Left footed players:

<img width="959" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-18 at 3 57 35 PM" src="https://github.com/aliiyevali/Soccer-Player-Analysis/assets/147966223/c2729efb-2d0d-4994-a058-05967ec81f39">

I conducted a hypothesis test to examine whether there is a significant difference in playmaking skills, as indicated by the number of assists, between left-footed and right-footed attacking players. To perform this analysis, I used the Mann-Whitney U test, which is appropriate for comparing non-normally distributed data.
The null hypothesis in this test is that there is no significant difference in assist production between left-footed and right-footed attackers. To determine whether I can reject the null hypothesis, I compare the calculated p-value to a predetermined significance level (alpha), which in this case is set at 0.10.
- The U-statistic provides a measure of the rank-based difference between the two groups. In this case, the U-statistic is 45358.5.
- The p-value, which is 0.4039, represents the probability of obtaining results as extreme as the ones observed in our data, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.
Given that the p-value (0.4039) is greater than the significance level (alpha = 0.10), I do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, I conclude that there is no significant difference in final passing ability, as measured by assists, between left-footed and right-footed attacking players based on the data analyzed.
As a result, there is no strong statistical evidence to support the idea that left-footed attackers provide significantly more assists than right-footed players in the dataset.
In the second phase of analysis, I conducted a hypothesis test to explore whether there is a significant difference in goal-scoring abilities between right-footed and left-footed players. To perform this analysis, I utilized the Mann-Whitney U test again, which is particularly suitable for comparing non-normally distributed data.
In this context, the null hypothesis posits that there is no significant difference in goal-scoring abilities between right-footed and left-footed players. To ascertain whether I can reject the null hypothesis, I compared the calculated p-value to a predetermined significance level (alpha), which in this analysis was set at 0.10.
- The U-statistic represents a measure of the rank-based difference between the two groups. In this case, the U-statistic is 52398.0.
- The p-value, which is approximately 0.0297, signifies the probability of observing results as extreme as those in our data, assuming that the null hypothesis holds true.
Given that the p-value (0.0297) is less than the significance level (alpha = 0.10), I have sufficient statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This implies that there is indeed a significant difference in goal-scoring abilities between right-footed and left-footed players, based on the most-recent data including more than 700 records.
In simpler terms, the results suggest that right-footed players tend to have superior goal-scoring abilities compared to their left-footed counterparts in the dataset. This finding provides support for the assumption that right-footed players excel in terms of goal scoring.
Our analysis offers insights into football player performance in the year 2023, but it's important to consider that expert opinions may have been formed based on data and observations from previous years. The world of football is dynamic, with tactics, strategies, and player roles evolving rapidly over time. What held true in the past may not necessarily hold in the present. Expert viewpoints often reflect insights gathered during different football eras.
In essence, football performance is a complex interplay of factors, including individual skills, team strategies, opponent tactics, and coaching philosophies. Our findings shed light on player performance specific to 2023, but they should be viewed within the broader context of an ever-changing sport, where tactics and strategies continue to evolve in response to contemporary demands and trends.
In conclusion, these findings emphasize the complexity of soccer player abilities, which are influenced by various factors beyond just their dominant foot. In my opinion, every individual attacking player has unique skills and generalizing players by only their foot preference is not logical at this point. 

# Tableau Dashboard and Results

<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 2 01 44 AM" src="https://github.com/aliiyevali/Soccer-Player-Analysis/assets/147966223/b4edc171-bb42-40ae-b386-3f397c18b9b9">

Radial Bar Charts:
The top-right corner of the display features a radial bar chart showcasing the leading countries with the highest number of valuable attacking football players. Each bar symbolizes a different country, with its length indicating the total value of attacking players from that nation—the longer the bar, the higher the players' value. Accompanying the chart is a ranked list of countries on the left, organized by the players' value, starting with the top country. Beside each country's name, the actual total value of their attacking players is indicated numerically. England, France, and Brazil are notable leaders in this chart, with Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy also securing spots in the top 10.
The second radial bar chart differs only in its criteria, focusing on the total minutes played by players from each country. Here, England, Spain, and France emerge as frontrunners, while Argentina, Belgium, and the Netherlands also make it into the top 10. This chart provides a different perspective on the contribution of players from various countries, measured in terms of their on-field time.

The Progress Map:
The "Progress Map" graph uses color intensity to indicate the progress of attacking players' market values in European countries over the last three years. Darker shades on the map represent countries with significant improvement or higher performance levels of attacking players, while lighter shades indicate less progress. This visualization allows for a quick comparative analysis of which countries have seen more substantial advancements in the values of their attacking football players in last 3 years.
We can divide Europe to 2 parts, While Western Europe continue to improve in soccer, Eastern Europe shows relatively less improvement. It also means trend will not stop and we will see Western Europe’s dominance in next years as in previous years. The Scandinavian countries have defied expectations with a significant improvement that can be considered most unexpected outcome from this graph.

Donut Charts:
The donut charts on the dashboard represent the distribution of goals scored and market values for players categorized by their preferred foot: right-footed, left-footed, and both-footed. The "Goal Distribution by Foot" chart illustrates the average goals scored by each category, providing insights into the goal-scoring tendencies according to the players' foot dominance. The "Value Distribution by Foot" chart, on the other hand, details the market value associated with players of each foot preference, highlighting the market value attributed to right-footed, left-footed, and ambidextrous players within the football market. These visualizations help to analyze the performance and market perception of different footed players. 
Left footed players are fewer than right-footed ones. Some sources, believe left-footed players are more valuable due to that reason. Our analysis almost resonates that with 5 million value difference between these 2 groups. In every economic situation, less can often hold more value. In the context of goals, it is evident that right-footed players tend to score relatively more, which aligns with the results of our hypothesis testing.

The Area Chart:
The position-based area chart illustrates the progress of players over time. Each player is represented by a distinct colored area on the chart, and the vertical axis shows their recent ages. As you move along the horizontal axis, the area under each player's curve reveals their cumulative progress in recent years. The chart offers a quick, insightful glimpse into how players evolve and compete, making it a valuable resource for decision-making and strategic planning.
In conclusion, there has been significant progress among center forwards in recent years, while right-wing players appear to have made comparatively less progress. Clubs should take special note of this finding when considering player transfers, as opting for right-wing players rather than left-wing players would likely be a more logical choice, given the expected scarcity of quality right wingers over time, as indicated by our graph.

The Bar Chart:
The bar chart labeled "Country-wise Goals and Injuries Comparison Chart" provides a visual comparison between the number of goals scored and the injuries sustained by football players from various countries. Each country is represented by a bar with size of goals and the color indicating the injuries. The bars reflect the total goals scored by players from that nation, while the injury colors indicate the frequency of injuries sustained over a specific period. 
As a result, it is evident that high-performing countries exhibit higher injury rates among their players. This contrast can provide valuable insights for discussions regarding the delicate balance between aggressive play and player safety within international teams, as well as the effectiveness of training and medical support across various footballing nations.
     Furthermore, it's important to consider that the top three countries, namely England, France, and Spain, produce a substantial number of talented players. However, it's worth noting that two of these countries boast the best leagues globally, while the French league is often regarded as one of the most physically demanding. The Premier League, in particular, features the highest number of games in a calendar year compared to other leagues, which could explain the higher incidence of injuries. This serves as a reminder that more games can lead to the development of exceptional players but also expose them to a higher risk of injuries and physical strain.

# Value Calculator

In the world of football (soccer), determining the value of a player can be a complex and sometimes biased process. Factors such as market trends and personal opinions can skew valuations. However, to bring some objectivity into the equation, I've created a function that calculates a player's value based on concrete metrics, free from any emotional bias.
Key Metrics Considered:
	Performance Score: I start by evaluating a player's offensive performance, which is a combination of the number of goals they've scored and the number of assists they've provided to their team.
Age: Age plays a crucial role in assessing a player's value. Different age groups are given different weightings to reflect their career stage.
Injury Duration: I take into account the total duration of injuries a player has suffered, which can impact their availability to their team.
Awards: The number of achievements a player has earned is factored in to recognize their excellence in the sport.
Output:
The function returns a calculated player value, providing an objective estimate of their worth.

Although our function may not offer a flawless representation of a player's value, it presents a structured and data-driven approach to the evaluation process. This approach can help mitigate the biases often linked to player valuations. To further enhance the function, we could consider assigning more weight to recent goals and introducing an additional factor that accounts for a player's experience by taking into consideration the various leagues they have played in. However, our dataset doesn’t contain that much information, it seems prudent to retain the function in its current form.
